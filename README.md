This is a sample project tried to see if jersey embedded server works fine.

The guidence is from here.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31992461/how-to-run-jersey-server-webservice-server-without-using-tomcat

To run the project via command line, use
 java -cp tempdegree-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.factor.temperature.Main
 
 Note : Getting response in browser didnt work, but via client we are able to get it in code.
